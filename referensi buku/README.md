# Book Recommendations for Data Science and Machine Learning

## High Priority (Start with these)
1. **[Data] Python Data Science Handbook (2017)**  
   A must-read for foundational knowledge in Python and common libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

2. **[O'REILLY] Data Science from Scratch - First Principles with Python**  
   Excellent for building foundational knowledge in data science and understanding key algorithms.

3. **[THE] Deep Learning (2016)**  
   If you're planning to dive into machine learning engineering, this provides a strong introduction to neural networks and deep learning.

4. **[ML] Introduction to Machine Learning with Python (2017)**  
   Beginner-friendly, focused on practical machine learning with Python.

5. **[Data] Think Like a Data Scientist (2017)**  
   Helps cultivate the mindset and approach required for data analysis and problem-solving.

## Medium Priority
1. **[Data] Think Stats (2014)**  
   Focuses on statistical methods and analysis, which are essential for data science but may overlap with other books.

2. **[NLP] Natural Language Processing with PyTorch (2019)**  
   Highly valuable if you aim to specialize in NLP but not necessary for general data science/ML.

3. **[O'REILLY] Hands On Machine Learning**  
   Comprehensive and practical for machine learning, great to read after the basics.

4. **Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python**  
   A solid foundation in statistics and its application in data science, especially regression and classification.

5. **Math for Machine Learning**  
   Essential for understanding the math behind algorithms but can be deferred if you're more focused on practical coding initially.

---

## Lower Priority (Can be skipped or deferred)
1. **[THE] A Course in Machine Learning (2013)**  
   Dated compared to modern resources like "Hands On Machine Learning."

2. **[THE] Neural Network Methods in Natural Language Processing (2017)**  
   Specialized for NLP, so defer unless NLP becomes a focus area.

3. **[Python] Fluent Python (2015)**  
   Useful for mastering Python but less critical for data science beginners.

4. **[Python] Introducing Python (2015)**  
   Skip if you already have Python skills.

5. **[Data] Think Bayes (2013)**  
   Focuses on Bayesian methods, which are niche and can be explored later.

6. **[Grokking] Machine Learning**  
   A beginner-friendly book but redundant if youâ€™ve already started with others like "Hands On Machine Learning."
